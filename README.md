Here’s a sample **README.md** file for your **Live Traffic Monitoring System** project:

# Live Traffic Monitoring System

This project uses **YOLOv3** to detect and count vehicles from live traffic camera feeds. It fetches images dynamically from specific traffic locations, analyzes the data, and displays the vehicle counts along with bounding boxes for visual representation.

## Features
- Fetches images from real-time traffic cameras.
- Detects vehicles such as **cars, buses, motorcycles, and trucks** using YOLOv3.
- Updates images every **60 seconds** dynamically.
- Displays **bar charts** for vehicle counts per camera angle.
- Interactive UI with **Streamlit**.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd traffic-monitoring
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download YOLOv3 weights and config files**:
   - [yolov3.weights](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)
   - [yolov3.cfg](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg)
   - [coco.names](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names)

   Place these files in the root directory.

## Usage

1. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   !wget -q -O - ipv4.icanhazip.com
   ```

    ```bash
   !streamlit run app.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501
   ```

2. **Select a city** from the dropdown to monitor traffic at that location.

3. Click **Start Monitoring** to fetch and analyze images dynamically every 60 seconds.
